We created a simulation of Pink Panther walking across a maze-like course
while avoiding obstacles and reaching the target input by the user,
on Visual Studio Code using the Python programming language, for our
Introduction to Computer Engineering course's lab final.

### **Python version:** 
3.6 - 3.8

### **Libraries used:** 
- roboticstoolbox
- math
- matplotlib.pyplot
- matplotlib.image
- numpy

## **User inputs:**
1. Starting coordinates *(The user must input BOTH the x & y coordinates of the starting point)
2. Target coordinates *(The user must input BOTH the x & y coordinates of the target point)
3. IF they would like to see changes in the any changes in the
direction or angle to the target
4. IF they would like to see changes in the any changes in the
direction or angle in each obstacle

## **Output of code:**


Figure description: As seen in the previous figure, the simulation is running
and Pink Panther is moving to the target, while avoiding the obstacles.

## **How the code works:**
The code is put together using the libraries mentioned previously
to create a simulation of a moving "vehicle", which in our case is Pink Panther,
that is able to move from a starting point input by the user to the target point- also
input by the user, whilst avoiding numerous objects.
The Pink Panther is able to identify the obstacles using "RangeBearingSensor"
and bypassing them. 

## **How to improve the code:**
