We created a simulation of Panther walking across a maze-like course
while avoiding obstacles and reaching the target input by the user,
on Visual Studio Code using the Python programming language, for our
Introduction to Computer Engineering course's lab final.

### **Python version(s):** 
3.6 - 3.8

### **Libraries imported:** 
- roboticstoolbox
- math
- matplotlib.pyplot
- matplotlib.image
- numpy

## **User inputs:**
1. Starting coordinates *(The user **must** input **BOTH** the x & y coordinates of the starting point)*
2. Target coordinates *(The user **must** input **BOTH** the x & y coordinates of the target point)*
3. IF they would like to see changes in the any changes in the
direction or angle to the target
4. IF they would like to see changes in the any changes in the
direction or angle in each obstacle

## **Output of code:**


Figure description: First, the user is required to enter the required points and decide whether to 
the changes in obstacle and target position, the Sensor Readings of the robots positions are then printed. 
As seen in the previous figure, the simulation is running and Panther is moving to the target, 
while avoiding collisions with the map walls and obstacles.

## **How the code works:**
The code is put together using the libraries mentioned previously
to create a simulation of a moving "vehicle", which in our case is Panther,
that is able to move from a starting point input by the user to the target point- also
input by the user, whilst avoiding numerous obstacles.
The Panther is able to identify the obstacles and walls using "RangeBearingSensor"
and bypassing them. 

## **How to improve the code:**
